We can also ask how much did the future gazers get right?

We have mobile phones, drones, selfie sticks and a host of other mobile technology that we never thought of and the stuff that was thought of, such as huge TVs and cars that didn't need petrol. Okay they don't run on waste food either.

Most important of all, we are still here, bullying still exists and more houses have been built.

Fortunately the consciousness has been rising and still rising. So be nice, don't compare yourself to anyone else, (save that for moneysupermarket.com) and above all, LIVE. 

No-one is getting out of here alive.
